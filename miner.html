  You are employed by a contractor that works for ISEF on Project Odysseus. Your work day just started, and you climb into your excavation equipment. You start where you left off yesterday, digging out a section in the ground for the massive ISEF mining facilities to be built into. AS you dig, your mind wanders to your wife and newborn son. "Only a few more months of this bullshit" you tell yourself, looking to the picture of your wife hanging on the windshield. The excavation machine lurches forward, bringing your attention back to your project. You have broken into a massive cavern. In your headlights are a bunch of creatures.
