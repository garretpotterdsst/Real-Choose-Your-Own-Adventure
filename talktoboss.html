      The Boss
    </title>
    <div class="background">
    <header class="story">
    You make your way out of your cubicle (another great thing about being an engineer on the moon: cubicles were a thing of the past) and start towards the executive offices. You took note of how quiet the office was. Usually by this time in the day, it was bustling with activity; there was not a soul around to give so much as a good afternoon to. When you arrived at the executive offices, they happened to  be just as vacant. <i> Where did everyone get off to? </i> you wonder to yourself. As far as you were aware, there wasn't anything special happening today. Maybe they had all decided to go out to lunch, and had forgotten to invite you along. After all, you had been absorbed in your work all morning long preparing your proposal for the big boss. Walking back towards your office, you noticed something on ground sticking out of the doorway to the office of one of your coworkers that vaguely resembled a leg.
